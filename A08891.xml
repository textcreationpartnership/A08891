            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I doubt not but ſhe had bin ſo inſtructed, but not by M. <hi>Vaux,</hi> for he to make ſure worke, hath taken that commandement who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of his catechiſme (as remouing a block as belike ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in their waie, which noe wiſe man will euer beſtowe anie labour about) recompencing his breuitie in that point, in telling the vſe of certaine <hi>Greeke</hi> words, <hi>Latria, Hyperdulia &amp; Dulia:</hi> where a learner is taught to worſhipp anie creature in heauen or earth, and commit (as he thinketh) noe I dolatry but noe otherwiſe then if a grand theife ſhould teach a puny to ſteale by precept, and when hee had committed the fact (that is, had ſtolen in deed) ſaie it were not the deed, and ſo leaue him to the gallowes.

For ſo hee ſaith plainlie in an other queſtion, though not of that waight, yet of that clearnes, where ſpeaking al in honor of our <hi>bleſſed Virgin Mary,</hi> doth not ſticke to ſale, that our Lorde &amp; redeemer did preſentlie after hee was riſen vp viſit<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2488:21"/>his moſt holie mother, vvhom we maie vvel beleiue to haue bin the firſt, albeit in the Goſpel, there be noe mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made therof; For, ſaith he, if (as the Evangeliſt reporteth) our Lord did,

                  <hi>becauſe Chriſt could not die but once,</hi> though the figures alſo therof in the law of nature &amp; of <hi>Moſes</hi> were truly called ſacrifices, as eſpecially this hie and marueilous <hi>commemoration of the ſame</hi> in the holy ſacrament of the aultar, according to the rite of the newe Teſtament is moſt <hi>truly</hi> and ſingularly (as S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) a ſacrifice; But neither this <hi>ſort.</hi> nor the other of the old law, being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and done by many Preiſts could bee the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming &amp; conſummating ſacrifice &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You would thinke that in theſe two verſes of their anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they had handled that text as though they had me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that Chriſt dying but once, had need neuer to haue died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Noe more ſhal he ſaie they; for in that violent, painful and bloody ſort (as hee died on the croſſe) he can neuer bee offered againe; here they exclude his dying againe, or often; but not his offering againe, or often: It is maruaile they did not deuiſe how he might die againe, ſo it were not in that <hi>violent, painfull, &amp; bloody ſort</hi> as his death was on the croſſe; as wel as deuiſe ſuch an offering, as ſhalbe neither <hi>violent, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> nor <hi>bloody:</hi> ſo where they ſhould lay their reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to proue either a <hi>reall offering</hi> or not; <hi>a reall dying</hi> or not, they leaue it in the halfe &amp; come in with
<hi>manners</hi> &amp; <hi>respects,</hi> altering cleane the nature of the thinge; For nether coulde Chriſt himſelfe (much leſſe any mortal man) offer himſelfe often without dying often, as is moſt plaine by the Apoſtle in the 4 laſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that 9. chapter, ſo their fumbling here, is with as ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe as D. <hi>Allens</hi> before cited, whoe maketh <hi>a reall offering</hi> (which they ſtick at, vnleſſe they will haue it neither <hi>violent, painfull, nor bloody,</hi> and then wherin is it
<hi>reall</hi>) &amp; <hi>a ſacramentall ſhedding of blood.</hi> Againe they ſaie that that one action on the Croſſe made the ful ranſome for the ſinns of the world; what need any more ſacrifice for ſinns then, as their is? But being<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2488:35"/>the ſame that his was, whie doth it not redeeme as his did, <hi>euen as a generall price &amp; ranſome,</hi> or let them ſhew wherin the defect is, that <hi>being the ſame Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>Furthermore, that <hi>reall immolation</hi> which D.

This is ſound &amp; Catholike, if he would abide by it, but within two leaues after, hee ſaith wee muſt beleiue the very preſence of Chriſts body and blood on Gods board, and that the Prieſts doe their ſacrifice, and bee therfore called ſacrificers.

               <p>Thus haue wee the ful of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſons to proue that <hi>the value,</hi> and ſtrength of the ſacrifice of the maſſe is
<hi>finite,</hi> wheras hee confeſſeth the <hi>ſacrifice of the Croſſe was infinite,</hi> ſo that by his owne grant, the difference betweene them is, as between <hi>finite &amp; infinite,</hi> which is diſproportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enough, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vpon wee may ſafly conclude, the Maſſe is not the ſacrifice of Chriſt.

I wil follow
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> in on note more about his maſſe, and ſo giue an ende to this part: Wee obiect the confirmation of a Teſtament dependeth on the death of the Teſtator, therfore the confirming of Chriſts te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament dependeth on his death; Or thus, Where a ſacrifice is, the teſtament is confirmed, but where a teſtament is, there is death, therfore the maſſe is a new teſtament, yea there are ſo many teſtaments as there be maſſes, &amp; Chriſt muſt ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> die as there be maſſes to ratifie &amp; eſtabliſh them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth, that the maſſe is not a new feting forth of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Chriſt, or is not a new teſtament, but a <hi>repetition</hi> of his owne, which he did &amp; confirmed by his death, ſo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before hee called the maſſe <hi>an iteration</hi> of the oblation of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus is <hi>Bellarmine</hi> content to make his maſſe a repetition and iteration of Chriſts ſacrifice, which a while after hee will not allow.

For in this of the maſſe they teach the offering vp of the ſonne of God to his father, which aſſertion had need (becauſe it is a matter of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt waight) to be ſtrongly confirmed by holy ſcripture; They teach a true ſacrifice a perfect &amp; reall, but when they come to confirme, that which firſt they lay downe, they ſpeake of the formes of bread and wine, deſtroying the truth of Chriſts naturall body. They make it bloody and vnbloody. They knowe not howe farre the Preiſt worketh in it, nor whether they were beſt to ſay it is the ſame that Chriſt did.
